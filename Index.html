            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Nahama Shannon Nothabiso Mango 
                Copywriter
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a creative problem solver, which drives my passion for copywriting. Writing and speaking have been my supreme interests since childhood. I enjoyed composing songs and poetry, and although I lost that passion for a while, Vega helped reignite it. As a Durban woman with an African background, I value community and culture. As a critical thinker and ambitious individual, I’m eager for opportunities to advance my career as a copywriter, believing we are a connected community.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my role as a copywriter, I also work as a radio presenter. My responsibilities include voice-over projects, writing radio scripts, and hosting shows. Working in a radio station is one of the most rewarding experiences, as it offers opportunities to learn more about people and the world around us. I have a non-profit organisation called the Nahama Foundation, where I give back to the community and make donations. In 2021, I completed a one-year course in beauty therapy and graduated as a beautician. Outside work, I enjoy spending time with my family, being outdoors, trying new activities, and focusing on my talents.
